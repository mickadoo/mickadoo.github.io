To mark a year since the release of Windows 10 Microsoft decided to celebrate by (in the best case scenario) messing up your
 bootloader configuration for dual-boot users, and (in my case) [destroying my Ubuntu partition][1]. I mean what better way to
combat your competition than destroying it completely? Ballsy move by Microsoft.

I actually liked Windows 10, and had been happily using it to play games for the last few months. And I can't say I hate having
a fresh instillation of Ubuntu either, back to basics. It even prompted me to put everything I did to get the basic set up
running [on github][2].

It's also a reminder to always back things up after I lost a days work on a dockerfile I'd been working on. You
know that feeling where you want to make your super new project into a nice state before your initial commit? Yeah, you should
 totally ignore that and do an initial commit with a readme containing only a smiley face or something, you won't regret it.
